This is my 3rd instalment in the ‘Little synths with BIG sound’ series.

This time around I’ve designed a 2 in 1 synth which I've called Ekoplazm! The first synth is a classic Dub Siren which I have paired up with a Delay and Reverb synth and includes feedback and a couple other tricks. You can play the Dub Siren through the Delay/Reverb section which gives it a rich and full sound or play other synths like my Proton & Elements synths through the Delay/Reverb section to add some tasty soundscapes to these synths.
